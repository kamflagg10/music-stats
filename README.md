# Project (In Progress)

This is a full stack web application built to visualize my Spotify listening history. This project was built with React on the frontend along with NodeJS and Express on the backend, utilizing MongoDB to store and query my data taken from Spotify's API.

Eventually, I plan to deploy this application via AWS.
